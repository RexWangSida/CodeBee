    "questionStatement": "A variable can be thought of as a container with a name, that stores some data.
    This data can be viewed, changed and use for other purposes. For example, a variable called num stores a value 5 as:\n\n
    num = 5\n\n 
    Your challenge here is to store the values 2 and 3 in two variables called a and b. 
    Then store the result of adding the value in these two variables in a new variable called c." ,
    "hints": [
                "1: The assignment operator can be used to assign a value to a variable.",
                "2: The + operator can be assigned on two variables. Eg: num1 + num2.",
                "3: The result of an operation can be directly stored in a variable. Eg: num3 = num1 + 5."
